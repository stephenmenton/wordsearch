# wordsearch
tool for finding all dictionary words in a sample wordsearch

This was a coding exercise bown from the memes of "The first 3 words you find describe you" frequently posted to Facebook. I wanted to know the most interesting words. So, I turned to code. Initially I wrote this in Perl. Then I took a stab at writing it in Python. Neither are as elegant as I'd like but they were quick.
